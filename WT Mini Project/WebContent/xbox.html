Welcome to a new generation of games and entertainment. Where games push the boundaries of realism. And television obeys your every command. Where you can jump from apps to a game in an instant. Where your experience is custom tailored to you. And the entertainment you love is all in one place. Welcome to the all-in-one, Xbox One.</p>

 





<p><b>The Best Games.</b><br>


Xbox One was built by gamers, for gamers. The perfect balance of power and performance, Xbox One takes gaming to a whole new level. Stunning realism. Advanced AI that adapts to the way you play. And a new generation of multiplayer that is both smarter and faster. Xbox One is simply the best gaming console we’ve ever made</p>






<p><b>Your games keep playing, even when you're not.</b><br>


Just because you’re not playing doesn’t mean your games have to stop. With Living Games technology and the power of the cloud, game worlds can be persistent. So the things you do in a game will stay that way. Plus your games are in sync with the real world, which means the latest stats can be automatically fed into your sports games. Advanced AI even allows your friends to play against your shadow when you’re not available. With Xbox One, the game never stops.</p>







<p><b>Play Xbox One games online or offline.</b><br>

Your Xbox One does not need to be connected for you to enjoy offline features of games. In fact, you can take the Xbox One anywhere and play any disc-based Xbox One game on it. The only times you need an online connection are for initial set-up of Xbox One, and to get the latest system and title updates before you start playing some games.
