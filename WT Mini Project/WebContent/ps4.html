	<b>Introduction</b>
	<br>
	<br>
The PS4 is the most powerful games console on the planet and it's now been on the shelves and in living rooms for over seven months.

With more graphical power than the Xbox One, 32 times more system memory than the PS3 and a firm focus on pure gaming experiences rather than media mojo, the PS4 has established itself as the next-gen console to beat.

It's a games console built by gamers for gamers. It won the hearts and minds of many from the word go, with lots of prospective next-genners left feeling alienated by some of Microsoft's bizarre policies and choices for the Xbox One - many of which were reversed as a result of a backlash.

Coming in at £349, the PS4 is the same price as Microsoft's Xbox One bundle without Kinect. It doesn't come with the PlayStation Camera but this can be bought separately for £45 if you so wish.
